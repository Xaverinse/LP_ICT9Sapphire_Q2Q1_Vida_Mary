					<td style="background-color: #FF992C; font-weight: bold;">Dogecoin (DOGE) is a peer-to-peer, open-source cryptocurrency. It is considered an altcoin and was launched in December 2013 with the image of a Shiba Inu dog named Kabosu as its logo. Dogecoin's blockchain has merit with its underlying technology derived from Litecoin. Notable features of Dogecoin—which uses the Scrypt algorithm are its low price and unlimited supply. Originally created as somewhat of a joke about cryptocurrency, the token became fairly popular with cryptocurrency fans. The community and developer humor included in the project adds to its appeal and is probably what has made it last longer than many other cryptocurrencies.</td>
